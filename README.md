# ChatClient

This project is focused around building a chat client that can connect to a chat server not made by ourselves.

So i made in response to it the java script called ChatClient.java that makes use of input and output on two different threads so it can read and write at the same time.

I wanted to test if my client to read and write to the client given/made by our teacher the ChatCLI.java script/client.

My results were happily as expected, my client could read and write to it and the same other way around.
